# Authpack

*Package of distributed client and server OAuth2 API's*

### Under development!!! By far not stable yet!!!

TODO:
  - Implement more tests, check latest OAuth2 draft and compare to current implementation 
  - Add more documentation
  - Add example(s)
  - Add OpenId connect implementation
  - Add client implementations (javascript server, browser, maybe others)

## What is Authpack?

Authpack is an open-source project that uses User Agents (i.e. browsers), [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and Open Source Packages to implement the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol as defined by the IETF. Later also OpenID Connect will be added.  

## How does it work?

TODO

## Where can I run Authpack?

Authpack can be used as Authentication and Authorization building block for client and server applications. 

## Installation

Get Authpack from NPM with:

````
npm install authpack
````

Or get Authpack from GitHub and then install the start scripts and all needed packages with:

````
git clone git://github.com/stolsma/authpack.git
cd authpack
npm install
````

# User Documentation

Authpack user documentation is still very much a work in progress. We'll be actively updating the documentation in the upcoming months to make it easier to get acclimated with `Authpack`.
